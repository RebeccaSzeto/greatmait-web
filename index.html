	<h1>Humani Maitreya's Noble Vow</h1>
	<p>Maitreya, the fully enlightened one vowed to bring the Pureland to the world so that all beings can live in universal harmony.</p>

<p>Maitreya is the great enlightened one.  Maitreya's enlightenment is the eternal realization and awakening of the conscience and the perfect practice of universal love. Maitreya is the embodiment of universal love. By this, Maitreya fully reveals universal respect universal dignity and unveils every aspect of the true essence of life.</p>

<p>Maitreya equally respects the existence of all beings, whether they are of the divine, astray, or from the abyss. In Maitreya's heart, all life, animals, birds, and fish are equally important and their life is as dignified as any human life. Maitreya's indiscriminate love for all beings is the key to lead and bring universal harmony to our world.</p>

<p>Maitreya knows that on the surface, all beings are different in form, awareness, and intelligence. But these are superficial and are not the true state of things. They are not the true body of beingness.</p>

<p>Whether they are divine beings from a higher realm of realization, a physical being of our world, the animal life form, or the souls from the dark abyss, at the very surface, sentient beings seem drastically different, but in truth we all the same, because our true spiritual body comes from the Divine Creator Laomu. We appear different in form, but our true Self comes from the same original source of divinity. For this reason, we are equally the same. Our conscience, spirit, or soul has come from the great Creator, Laomu.</p>

<p>Maitreya knows this and loves not only the form in which we exist in, He accepts and embraces us beyond form. He sees our nature, our origin, because He sees the divine conscience within all of us. He sees that we are truly brothers and sisters in the spiritual line of conscience. Maitreya loves and respects all things despite how we humans value them. Maitreya loves and respects you and me.</p>

<p>Maitreya's great love is fully revealed in His Noble Vow, a vow that has come to the climax of full enlightenment. Let us now have a better understanding of Maitreya's Noble Vow</p>

<p>Maitreya vowed to bring universal happiness to all beings in all realms of existence. This may sound a bit simple and plan to be graded as The Noble Vow, but it is by no means simple. Maitreya means it.</p>

<p>It is in Maitreya will and soul to bring every being the happiness they seek. He wants to fulfill all being's deepest yearnings and cries for joy and peace. He wants to help us solve all the problems, which we have not been able to solve, the crime, violence, hate, and fear. He wants to bring the Heavenly Kingdom, the Pureland here on earth so beings can enjoy the fertility of abundance and eternal joy This is the great vow of Maitreya. And He will make the Heavenly Kingdom a living reality in our world. Only Maitreya, the Perfectly Enlightened One, has vowed to such a glorious statement and this unravels with His coming.</p>

<p>To witness and to live the coming of such a wonderful era, Maitreya tells us to receive it with His teachings on universal love. In Maitreya's great teaching of universal love, Maitreya sets Himself as an example of how we can reach such a promise land. "No blame for blame, and no abuse for abuse" He says. "Reveal universal love through your smile, give love with your heart, and give love in your acts."</p>

<p>These are the keys to respecting and dignifying life. When we don't practice this, we are not respecting the dignity of life, nor are we honoring the Divine Creator-Laomu, the spiritual line of our origin. If we cannot respect the dignity all life, will we have the heart to receive the coming of the Pureland, how can we live in peace and harmony with other beings How can we make the Heavenly Kingdom a reality on earth, if we cannot respect the dignity of other's existence. How can we enjoy true joy if we have hate and discrimination?</p>

<p>Only through the teachings of Maitreya, which is the practicing of universal love, the Pureland comes. And Maitreya will come to guide us, teach us, and show us how we can achieve this state of peace and harmony.</p>

<p>Maitreya's coming brings universal harmony to all beings. This is Maitreya's Noble Vow. It will put an end to our long age of ignorance. His teaching will revolutionize humanity and technology as He will guide these with morals and conscience.</p>

<p>When we have such mindset, this century will shift from the dark ages of violence and crime, a period of ill morals and ill conscience into the Golden Age of enlightenment. This will be a century of perfect conscience Maitreya will guide us through and to unearth the true glories of humanity. Through all the achievements of technology, science, and all the different fields of humanity, the dignity of humans can exist upright and holy. Maitreya brings the sanctity of the Pureland to our world. We need to open our hearts to receive its coming. And we need to sanctify ourselves so that we can come to unison with the coming of the Pureland.</p>

<p>No matter how advanced technology may be, no matter how magnificent humanity becomes, if they don't bring the peace and harmony to the world, if they don't bring awakening to the conscience, then technology and humanity are meaningless.</p>
